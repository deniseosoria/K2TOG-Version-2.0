/*
 * ANALYTICS MODEL - Class Session Based
 * 
 * All analytics are now calculated based on ACTIVE and COMPLETED class sessions
 * within the user's selected date range, rather than general date filters.
 * 
 * This approach provides more accurate insights for child care businesses:
 * - Revenue is calculated for actual class periods
 * - Enrollments are counted for specific class sessions
 * - Performance metrics reflect actual class delivery
 * - Date ranges represent when classes actually happened
 * 
 * Key changes:
 * - All queries now JOIN with class_sessions table
 * - Date filters apply to session_date and end_date
 * - Only 'scheduled' and 'completed' sessions are included
 * - Enrollments and payments are linked to specific sessions
