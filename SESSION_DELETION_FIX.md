# Session Deletion with Historical Archival - Implementation Summary

## Problem
When deleting class sessions through the edit class form, sessions were properly archived to historical tables. However, when using the direct session deletion endpoint (`DELETE /api/sessions/:sessionId`), sessions were being hard deleted without preserving the data in historical tables.

## Solution
Modified the `deleteSession` function in `server/controllers/sessionController.js` to implement the same archival pattern used in the class edit form.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Session Deletion Logic (`server/controllers/sessionController.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
async function deleteSession(req, res) {
  const { sessionId } = req.params;
  try {
    // Optionally, delete enrollments for this session first
    await pool.query('DELETE FROM enrollments WHERE session_id = $1', [sessionId]);
    const result = await pool.query(
      'DELETE FROM class_sessions WHERE id = $1 RETURNING *',
      [sessionId]
    );
    // ... rest of function
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
async function deleteSession(req, res) {
  const { sessionId } = req.params;
  const client = await pool.connect();
  
  try {
    await client.query('BEGIN');

    // Check if session exists and get its details
    const sessionResult = await client.query(
      'SELECT * FROM class_sessions WHERE id = $1 AND deleted_at IS NULL',
      [sessionId]
    );

    if (sessionResult.rows.length === 0) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Session not found' });
    }

    const session = sessionResult.rows[0];

    // Check if session has enrollments
    const enrollmentsResult = await client.query(
      'SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM enrollments WHERE session_id = $1',
      [sessionId]
    );

    const hasEnrollments = parseInt(enrollmentsResult.rows[0].count) > 0;

    if (hasEnrollments) {
      // Archive the session to historical_sessions
      const historicalSessionResult = await client.query(
        `INSERT INTO historical_sessions (
          original_session_id, class_id, session_date, end_date, start_time, end_time,
          capacity, enrolled_count, instructor_id, status, archived_reason
        ) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11)
        RETURNING id`,
        [
          session.id,
          session.class_id,
          session.session_date,
          session.end_date,
          session.start_time,
          session.end_time,
          session.capacity,
          session.enrolled_count,
          session.instructor_id,
          session.status,
          'Session deleted by admin'
        ]
      );

      const historicalSessionId = historicalSessionResult.rows[0].id;

      // Archive enrollments for this session
      await client.query(
        `INSERT INTO historical_enrollments (
          original_enrollment_id, user_id, class_id, session_id, historical_session_id,
          payment_status, enrollment_status, admin_notes, reviewed_at, reviewed_by, enrolled_at, archived_reason
        )
        SELECT id, user_id, class_id, session_id, $1, payment_status, enrollment_status,
               admin_notes, reviewed_at, reviewed_by, enrolled_at, 'Session deleted by admin'
        FROM enrollments WHERE session_id = $2`,
        [historicalSessionId, sessionId]
      );

      // Remove enrollments from active table
      await client.query('DELETE FROM enrollments WHERE session_id = $1', [sessionId]);
    }

    // Soft delete the session (mark as deleted instead of actually deleting)
    await client.query(
      'UPDATE class_sessions SET deleted_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = $1',
      [sessionId]
    );

    await client.query('COMMIT');
    res.json({ message: 'Session deleted successfully and archived to historical tables' });
  } catch (error) {
    await client.query('ROLLBACK');
    console.error('Error deleting session:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete session' });
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Database Transaction**: Uses a database transaction to ensure data consistency
2. **Historical Archival**: Archives sessions and enrollments to historical tables before deletion
3. **Soft Delete**: Uses soft delete (sets `deleted_at` timestamp) instead of hard delete
4. **Data Preservation**: Preserves all session and enrollment data for future reference
5. **Consistent Behavior**: Now matches the behavior of session deletion in the class edit form

## Testing

Created and ran a test script that verified:
- ✅ Session is properly archived to `historical_sessions`
- ✅ Enrollments are properly archived to `historical_enrollments`
- ✅ Session is soft deleted (not hard deleted)
- ✅ Active enrollments are removed from the `enrollments` table
- ✅ Correct archived reason is set: "Session deleted by admin"

## Result

Now when you delete a session through any method (edit class form or direct session deletion), the session and its enrollments will be properly preserved in the historical tables, ensuring no data loss and maintaining a complete audit trail.
